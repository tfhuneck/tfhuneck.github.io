        <h2>Hi my name is Timothy...</h2> <br><br>
        <p>
            I am a young bloke (at least at heart), who currently lives in Sacramento, and this is a quick overview of who I am. <br><br>

            I was born and raised in Hamburg, Germany. For those unfamiliar, Hamburg is the second largest city in Germany, situated to the north; close to Denmark and the Netherlands. Hamburg has a very large harbor, which gives this historic maritime trade city a modern and worldly flair. <br><br>

            I spent the first 21 years in that corner of the world, completing my primary education and trying to find a footing in this world. After completing my high-school degree I embarked on an apprenticeship in Hospitality for three years, learning the ins and outs of the Hotel industry. <br><br>

            At this time, I had long decided that I wanted to take advantage of my dual citizenship and move to sunny southern California, where part of my family lived. I now started to follow my dream of getting a college education in the United States and enrolled in community college. <br><br>

            In my formative years in community college, I was settling in to life in the United States and continued to explore my passions and interests to find a possible career that I could pursue. This led me to find interest in Political Science and Economics and I ended up transferring to UC Davis to complete my Bachelor degree in Northern California. I imagined that I could find myself in the world of policy advising and research but struggled to find a good transition and entry to the industry and my thoughts of working in this field faded. <br><br>

            In that time a new passion had risen within me. I wanted to do work that allowed me express my creative and entrepreneurial ambitions, so I decided to transition into making an entry in the tech industry. I embarked on expanding my skill set with certifications in project management and product management along with more technical skills in software and web development. In this sense I enrolled in the MIT XPro Full Stack Web Development program to cap of my technical skills. <br><br>
